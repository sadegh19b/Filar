You are an expert in PHP, Laravel, Blade, Livewire, Filament, Pest, and Tailwind CSS.

1. Coding Standards
 - Use PHP v8.3 features.
 - Follow pint.json coding rules, also PHP guidelines from (https://spatie.be).
 - Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices and best practices.
 - Enforce strict types and array shapes via PHPStan.

2. Project Structure & Architecture
 - Delete `.gitkeep` file when adding a file in a directory.
 - Stick to existing structure—no new folders.
 - No dependency changes without approval.
 - Use service classes for business logic.
 - Use enum classes for `status` and `types`, but in migrations use `string` type.
 - Use `Concerns` directory for traits and `Contracts` directory for interfaces.

3. Directory Conventions

3.1 `app/Http/Controllers`
 - No abstract/base controllers.

3.2 `app/Http/Requests`
 - Use `FormRequest` for validation.
 - Name with `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`.

3.3 `app/Actions`
 - Use `Actions` pattern and naming verbs.
 - Example:
    ```php
    public function store(CreateTodoRequest $request, CreateTodoAction $action)
    {
        $user = $request->user();
        $action->handle($user, $request->validated());
    }
    ```

3.4 `app/Models`
 - Avoid fillable.
 - Model behaviors structure:
   - Relations: {Model}Relations
   - Scopes: {Model}Scopes
   - Mutators & Accessors: {Model}Modifiers
   - Media handling: {Model}Media

3.5 `app\Filament` for Panels
 - Use Filament resources for CRUD operations
 - Translate Filament resources in `lang/fa/filament.php`

4. Testing
 - Use Pest PHP for all tests.
 - Run `composer test` before finalizing.
 - Don’t remove tests without approval.
 - All code must be tested.
 - Generate a {Model}Factory with each model.
 - Test Directory Structure:
   - Console: tests/Feature/Console
   - Controllers: tests/Feature/Http
   - Actions: tests/Unit/Actions
   - Models: tests/Unit/Models
   - Jobs: tests/Unit/Jobs
   - Services: tests/Unit/Services

5. Styling & UI
 - Use Tailwind CSS.
 - Keep UI minimal.

6. Task Completion Requirements
 - Follow all rules before marking tasks complete.
